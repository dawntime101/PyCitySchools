#Observable Trends in Our PyCity Schools Data Analysis

Top Performing Schools: Our top 5 performing schools are all Charter Schools. This is not to say that being a charter school is the reason for performing better, but charter schools have a significantly lower number of total students that they account for, thus showing top performing schools are those that have less students to account for.

Total Budget: Those schools with a higher number of total students seem to get a larger budget per student. This does not seem to affect the scores as much as the total students enrolled in each school. Those schools that received a larger budget show lower test scores than the schools with a smaller budget. 

With these two data trends, I can conclude that that the total number of students that schools account for seem to be directly related to performance more than the budget schools receive is related. Students enrolled in more populated schools equates to larger class sizes, and the lack of individual student attention could be hurting scores more than the amount of money they are allotted.
